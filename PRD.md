# Interactive Particle Kanban - Product Requirements Document

Create a visually stunning project management application that combines an interactive particle system background with a functional kanban board for team workflow visualization.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. Immersive - Users feel drawn into a dynamic, responsive visual environment
2. Productive - Clear workflow visualization helps teams track progress effectively  
3. Delightful - Particle interactions provide moments of joy during work sessions

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Combines visual artistry with practical project management functionality

## Essential Features

### Interactive Particle Background
- **Functionality**: Canvas-based particle system with mouse interaction effects
- **Purpose**: Creates an engaging, premium feel that differentiates from standard project tools
- **Trigger**: Automatic animation on page load, mouse interactions create ripples and particle responses
- **Progression**: Page loads → particles animate → user moves mouse → particles react → clicking creates firework effects
- **Success criteria**: Smooth 60fps animation, responsive particle behavior, visually appealing color transitions

### Kanban Board Management
- **Functionality**: Full CRUD operations for work items across customizable columns
- **Purpose**: Enables teams to visualize workflow and track project progress
- **Trigger**: User clicks "+" button or edits existing items
- **Progression**: Click add → side panel opens → fill form → submit → item appears in column
- **Success criteria**: Persistent data storage, smooth form interactions, immediate visual feedback

### Work Item Details
- **Functionality**: Side panel for creating/editing items with priority, type, assignee fields
- **Purpose**: Captures comprehensive task information for better project planning
- **Trigger**: Click add button or edit existing item
- **Progression**: Trigger action → panel slides in → form validation → save → panel closes → data persists
- **Success criteria**: Form validation works, data persists between sessions, smooth panel animations

## Edge Case Handling
- **Empty States**: Graceful handling when columns have no items with helpful prompts
- **Long Content**: Text truncation and tooltips for lengthy titles/descriptions
- **Invalid Data**: Form validation prevents empty required fields
- **Performance**: Particle system adapts count based on screen size for smooth performance

## Design Direction
The design should feel cutting-edge and premium, balancing visual sophistication with functional clarity. Rich interface with dynamic particles creates an immersive workspace environment.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Deep space blues contrasted with vibrant interactive accents create technological sophistication with energetic interaction moments.

- **Primary Color**: Deep space blue (oklch(0.25 0.1 250)) - communicates professionalism and depth
- **Secondary Colors**: Muted grays (oklch(0.95 0.01 250)) for content areas, maintaining focus
- **Accent Color**: Electric cyan (oklch(0.7 0.15 200)) for interactive elements and particle highlights
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Deep Blue #1a1a3a): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #f5f5f7): Dark text (#2a2a2a) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Deep Blue #1a1a3a): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Electric Cyan #00d4ff): Dark text (#1a1a1a) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey modern precision with excellent readability for productivity applications.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Hero Title): Inter Bold/48px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/32px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Column Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Task Content): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Labels (Form Fields): Inter Medium/12px/wide letter spacing

## Animations
Contextually appropriate motion enhances the premium feel while supporting productivity workflows through purposeful micro-interactions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Particle movements reflect energy and creativity while form transitions provide clear feedback
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Particles get primary animation focus, UI elements use subtle secondary motions

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for task items, Dialog/Sheet for side panels, Buttons with loading states, Form inputs with validation
- **Customizations**: Custom canvas particle system, animated panel slides, gradient overlays for depth
- **States**: Hover effects on task cards, active states for form inputs, loading states for actions
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clean, technical aesthetic (Plus, Edit, Trash, User)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 1rem base unit with 0.5rem for tight spacing, 2rem for section separation
- **Mobile**: Responsive grid collapses to single column, side panel becomes full-screen modal on mobile
